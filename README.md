# MUSIC-Algorithm
Implementation of MUSIC Algorithm in python

## There are 3 files. Run the covmat.py in order to see the results of the algorithm.

It will ask for 3 inputs
One is the number of array elements, second is the spacing between each array in the antenna array, and the third is the number of incoming/input signals

It will print estimated DOAs viz. angles in degreess based on the number of sources and a plot showing the spectrum with the corresponding peaks.

## The .ipynb file is a jupyter source file which contains the peak-finder algorithm. It was done to understand of how the peak finder works and is an essential part of the MUSIC algorithm as well.
One must have a jupyter notebook installed. Follow the below instructions to download it:
